# Data Project

## Overview
This repository contains ideas and initial setups for data-centric projects aimed at leveraging data science and engineering technologies. Each project idea outlined below explores real-world applications, ranging from energy price forecasting to air quality monitoring. The projects are designed to use a mix of proven and emerging technologies to create robust, scalable solutions.

## Key Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language used for data processing, analysis, and automation.
- **SQL**: For structured data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
- **Spark**: Utilized for handling big data processing tasks.
  
### Possible Integrations
- **Kafka**: To enable real-time data streaming and processing.
- **Airflow**: For workflow automation and scheduling of data pipelines.

## Project Ideas

### 1. UK Energy Price Forecasting & Dashboard
- **APIs**: 
  - *NGED API*: To retrieve energy distribution data.
  - *ELEXON API*: To access market data and energy prices.
- **Functionality**:
  - Regular updates to a SQL database with the latest energy pricing data.
  - Publishing this data to a real-time dashboard or webpage.
  
### 2. Air Quality Project
- **APIs**: 
  - *Google Maps API*: To access geospatial data.
  - *AirVisual API*: To obtain real-time air quality information.
  - *Weather API*: To integrate weather conditions for improved predictions.
- **Functionality**:
  - Combining traffic and air quality data to monitor current environmental conditions.
  - Forecasting future air quality across different regions using predictive modeling.

## How to Get Started
1. **Set up the environment**: Virtual environment and repo setup.
2. **Configure API Access**: Ensure API keys and tokens are securely stored and accessible by the project scripts.
3. **Run the initial scripts**: Start by running the data extraction scripts to populate the database with initial datasets.
